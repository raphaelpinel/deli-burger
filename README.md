I've been coding along this app with the excellent tutorial on Udemy [React 16.6 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Functionalities that I added by myself:

- limit the maximum amount of ingredients to 8, display a warning and disable the "add" buttons.
- used css modules without ejecting as available in React 16.7
- used the new React syntax <> instead of using fragments
- created a favicon
- added price to checkout summary

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
